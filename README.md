If the `toolchain` is not provided, it will be resolved using `rustup toolchain list | grep default`.

## Examples

As a `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` user, releases of `rls-preview` are quite rare,
which is why I created this app.

Here are a different examples of how this binary can be used.


### Install latest release that matches the current default toolchain and its components
```bash
# This command will:
#  - Find the correct release.
#  - Install it using `rustup toolchain install`.
#  - Move the newly installed toolchain from `channel-date-target` to `channel-target`,
#    overriding the previous one.
$ rustup-find --verbose --offset 25 replace

[i] Channel: nightly.
[i] Target: x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.
[i] Required components: cargo, rls-preview, rust-analysis, rust-docs, rust-mingw, rust-std, rustc.
[i] The following component was missing in 2018-07-21: rls-preview.
[i] The following component was missing in 2018-07-20: rls-preview.

```

### Install latest release that matches the current default toolchain and its components
```bash
# This command will:
#  - Find the correct release.
#  - Install it using `rustup toolchain install`.
$ rustup-find install

[+] Found valid toolchain: nightly-2018-07-19-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.
[+] Installed toolchain nightly-2018-07-19-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.
```

### Find latest release that matches the given toolchain and its components
```bash
# This command will:
#  - Find the correct release, and return it.
$ rustup-find --toolchain nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc

nightly-2018-08-17-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

### Example failure
```bash
$ rustup-find --days 5 --verbose
